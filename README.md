# OsmAPP

Let's create a universal app for OpenStreetMap ecosystem.
It should be as easy to use as Google Maps, including clickable POIs and editing capabilites.
Built with React, Next.js and Maplibre GL.
See also [SotM 2021 talk](https://github.com/zbycz/osmapp-talk).

- master branch: https://osmapp.org
- examples: [Empire State Building](https://osmapp.org/way/34633854#17.00/40.7483/-73.9864), [Prague Castle](https://osmapp.org/relation/3312247#17.00/50.0900/14.4000) or click just anything

### project OpenClimbing.org (beta)

Open climbing maps and topos. Photos are uploaded to _Wikimedia Commons_ and route data stored in _OpenStreetMap_ ([spec](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:wikimedia_commons:path)).

- master branch: https://openclimbing.org
- examples: [Prokopské údolí](https://openclimbing.org/relation/17262674),
  [Roviště](https://openclimbing.org/relation/17130100),
  [Lomy nad Velkou](https://openclimbing.org/relation/17089246) or click just anything.
- This is the same app served on another domain – only difference is branding and default layers.

## How to contribute 🐱‍💻

You may [add issues](https://github.com/zbycz/osmapp/issues) here on GitHub, or try to update the code in three simple steps:

1. edit code online with pencil icon (this opens a pull-request) ✏️
2. wait few minutes for a preview URL 💬
3. iterate 🔁

> If you are a JS dev, you may also `git clone` / `yarn` / `yarn dev` \
> Or [open OsmAPP in gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/zbycz/osmapp) or GitHub Codespaces – full dev environment in your browser. \
> If Vercel build fails, please run `yarn build` locally to debug it. \
> [Architecture DOCS here](./DOCS.md).
