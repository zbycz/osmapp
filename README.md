# OsmAPP – beta

Lets create an universal OSM web app for broad public. It should be as easy to use as Google Maps and offer editing capabilites like Maps.me or Osmand. See also [SotM 2021 talk](https://github.com/zbycz/osmapp-talk).

- master branch: https://osmapp.org
- examples: [Empire State Building](https://osmapp.org/way/34633854#17.00/40.7483/-73.9864), [Prague Castle](https://osmapp.org/relation/3312247#17.00/50.0900/14.4000) or click just anything
